      <h2>About the Program</h2>
          
            <p>We understand that education and experience shouldn’t be mutually exclusive. That’s why we introduced Grow with Sterling—a purpose-driven initiative to help young talents gain access to quality education, while also building the confidence and capabilities to thrive in the workplace.</p>
            <p>As a participant, you will be enrolled in one of our partner institutions and work with us at Sterling in a structured work-study model. This means you won’t just be learning in the classroom, you will be applying your knowledge in real life, gaining hands-on experience, and growing every day.</p>
            <p>This is our way of saying: We believe in investing in your future—because we know the impact one determined young person can have. Now, imagine what many driven young people, like you, can achieve when we all come together.</p>
